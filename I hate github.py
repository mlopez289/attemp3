  This is what bothers me, using the values n=1 & m=2 should result in 'trig' being zero, but instead I get a value
  that isn't zero but eventually returns the displacement you calculated in the Water Resonance notes, but off by
  a factor of 10^-33. Using n=2 & m=1 (which feels more correct since it means sine and cosine will be one) instead
  gives a wildy wrong answer. help!

def camera_simulation(img, bit_depth=8, gain=0, black_level=1, dark_noise=3.71, gain16=2.89):
    '''
    Compute a simulated image from a CMOS/CCD camera.
    Adds dark and shot noise, but not non-linearity or fixed pattern noise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : 2D numpy array
        Input image, with brightness specified in electrons.  The maximum
        possible brightness should be 2**16 / gain16 / 10**(gain/20).
        With default conditions this is ~22,700.

    Keywords
    --------
    bit_depth : int (default: 8)
        The bit depth of the output image; typically 8, 12, or 16.
    gain : float (default: 0)
        The readout gain in dB.  Usually 0--40 or 0--20, depending on the camera.
        For maximum noise performance, this is typically left at 0.  This has
        the same effect as setting the `Gain` attribute on the camera.
    black_level : float (defaul: 1)
        The black level in percent.  Has the same effect as setting the
        `BlackLevel` attribute on the camera.
    dark_noise : float (default: 3.71)
        The per-pixel dark noise in electrons.  Typically 2--20.
    gain16 : float (default: 2.89)
        The camera readout gain in DU / e-, assuming 16 bit depth.  For FLIR
        camera (formerly PointGrey), this is typically 1--10.  If your docs
        specify a number less than 1, this is the *recipricol* of this number.
        Note: this number should not change if you reduce the bit depth;
        leave it as is, and the code will take care of it.
    '''
    bit_depth = int(bit_depth)
    if (bit_depth > 16) or (bit_depth < 8):
        raise ValueError('bit_depth must be between 8 and 16.')

    noise = np.random.randn(*img.shape) * np.sqrt(dark_noise**2 + img)
    max = 2**16 - 1
    bl = max * black_level/100

        return img_u.astype('u1')
    else: return img_u << (16 - bit_depth)
